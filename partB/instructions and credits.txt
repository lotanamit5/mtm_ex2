Instructions:
	use autoGameTester.cpp as your main
	redirect the input files (<) and output files (>)
	you may use the following bash (linux) command if you want: (replace <executable> with your executable name)
		run all 10 tests:
			for i  in {0..9}; do <executable> < game_input_$i.txt > my_output_$i.txt ; done
		to check for diffs in output, you can then use:
			for i  in {0..9}; do diff -s -q game_output_$i.txt my_output_$i.txt ; done
	

An error you might encounter:
	if the program exits right after the first exception, it probably means you forgot to declare the Exception inheritance as public.
